## üìä Credit Score Calculation

### Score Range
- **Minimum Score:** 300
- **Maximum Score:** 900
- **Categories:**
  - 800-900: Excellent
  - 700-799: Good
  - 600-699: Fair
  - 500-599: Poor
  - 300-499: Very Poor

### Scoring Components

The credit score is calculated using five key components with different weightings:

#### 1. Payment Behavior (45% weight)
**What it measures:** Timeliness and consistency of payments

**Factors:**
- On-time payment percentage
- Average days late for overdue payments
- Payment frequency and patterns
- Early payment bonuses

**Calculation:**
```
Payment Score = (On-time payments / Total payments) √ó 100
Adjustments:
- Early payments: +5 points
- 1-7 days late: -2 points per day
- 8-15 days late: -5 points per day
- 15+ days late: -10 points per day
```

#### 2. Credit Utilization (25% weight)
**What it measures:** How much of available credit is being used

**Factors:**
- Current credit usage percentage
- Historical utilization patterns
- Credit limit adherence

**Calculation:**
```
Utilization Score = 100 - (Used Credit / Credit Limit √ó 100)
Optimal range: 0-30% utilization = 100 points
31-60% utilization = 70 points
61-80% utilization = 40 points
81-100% utilization = 20 points
```

#### 3. Transaction Consistency (15% weight)
**What it measures:** Regularity and predictability of business transactions

**Factors:**
- Order frequency consistency
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Business growth trends
- Order value stability

**Calculation:**
```
Consistency Score = Base score (60) + Adjustments
Regular monthly orders: +20 points
Seasonal consistency: +15 points
Growing order values: +10 points
Erratic patterns: -20 points
```

#### 4. Relationship Stability (10% weight)
**What it measures:** Length and depth of business relationships

**Factors:**
- Duration of supplier relationships
- Number of active suppliers
- Supplier diversity
- Relationship quality ratings

**Calculation:**
```
Relationship Score = (Months in business / 12) √ó 10 + Supplier diversity bonus
Long-term relationships (12+ months): +30 points
Multiple suppliers (3+): +20 points
Supplier ratings average: Rating √ó 10
```

#### 5. Market Reputation (5% weight)
**What it measures:** Industry standing and peer feedback

**Factors:**
- Supplier feedback scores
- Industry certifications
- Business registration status
- Market presence duration

**Calculation:**
```
Reputation Score = (Average supplier rating √ó 20) + Certification bonus
GST registration: +10 points
Business license: +10 points
Industry certifications: +15 points
```

### Final Score Calculation

```
Final Credit Score = (Payment Behavior √ó 0.45) + 
                    (Credit Utilization √ó 0.25) + 
                    (Transaction Consistency √ó 0.15) + 
                    (Relationship Stability √ó 0.10) + 
                    (Market Reputation √ó 0.05)
```
